# So you wanna be a software architect?

This aims to be a collection of resources if you decide you want to train yourself to be a software architect.

In phase 1, it'll be just a bunch of links put into this readme.  
In phase 2, it should have a structure, a good start for everyone (hopefully), but not a complete thing.  
In phase 3, it'll be an ultimate guideline on the topic "How to be a software architect".  

Let's go.

Oh, I almost forget: do contribute, I have a lot of things to learn (eg. proper written english :).

# Phase 1

(don't worry, phase 2 won't look like this)

## One-liners: The architect ...

- makes decisions on things which are expensive to change later
- plans everything what the client not asked specifically but necessary for the product (non-functional requirements)
- is not always there but an architecture is
- shouldn't be always the best developer (who is tend to keep the hard problems for themself)
- should code in a daily basis

## Architecture

### Different architect roles

[Software architect (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect)

> A software architect is a software developer expert who makes high-level design choices and tries to enforce technical standards, including software coding standards, tools, and platforms.

> Architects make high-level design choices based on their programming experience. An architect has thought through all the aspects of a software, just like an architect that builds a house. A construction architect knows where the ducts will be, where the electric connections will be and where the wall outlets will be. A design that a common person sees is just the walls and windows but a detailed design that is abstracted from the outsider are also present with the architect. In addition, the architect may sometimes propose technical standards, including coding standards, tools, or platforms.

> Software architects may also be engaged in the design of the architecture of the hardware environment, or may focus entirely on the design methodology of the code.

> Architects can use various software architectural models that specialize in communicating architecture.

| Architect type | Strategic thinking | System interactions | Communication | Design |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :------------- | :------ |
| enterprise architect | across projects | highly abstracted | across organization | minimal, high level |
| solutions architect | focused on solution | very detailed | multiple teams | detailed |
| application architect | component re-use, maintainability | centered on single application | single project | very detailed |

[Solution architecture (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_architecture)

> Solution architecture is a practice of defining and describing an architecture of a system delivered in context of a specific solution and as such it may encompass description of an entire system or only its specific parts. Definition of a solution architecture is typically led by a solution architect.

> According to Forrester Research, solution architecture is one of the key methods by which enterprise architecture delivers value to the organization. Solution architecture activities take place during solution ideation, solution design, and solution implementation. During ideation, solution architecture establishes the complete business context for the solution and defines the vision and requirements for the solution. During design, solution architecture elaborates potential options, which may include RFIs, RFPs or prototype development. It selects the optimal option and develops the roadmap for the selected solution. During implementation, solution architecture communicates the architecture to the stakeholders, and guides the implementation team.

[Application architect (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_architecture#Application_architect)

> The Application architect is a lead or technical manager in the computer programming team who is specialized in the application built and the technologies used.

> An applications architecture describes the behavior of applications used in a business, focused on how they interact with each other and with users. It is focused on the data consumed and produced by applications rather than their internal structure. In application portfolio management, applications are mapped to business functions and processes as well as costs, functional quality and technical quality in order to assess the value provided.

[Enterprise architecture (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_architecture)

> Enterprise architecture (EA) is "a well-defined practice for conducting enterprise analysis, design, planning, and implementation, using a comprehensive approach at all times, for the successful development and execution of strategy. Enterprise architecture applies architecture principles and practices to guide organizations through the business, information, process, and technology changes necessary to execute their strategies. These practices utilize the various aspects of an enterprise to identify, motivate, and achieve these changes."

> Practitioners of enterprise architecture, enterprise architects, are responsible for performing the analysis of business structure and processes and are often called upon to draw conclusions from the information collected to address the goals of enterprise architecture: effectiveness, efficiency, agility, and continuity of complex business operations.
