# So you wanna be a software architect?

This aims to be a collection of resources if you decide you want to train yourself to be a software architect.

In phase 1, it'll be just a bunch of links put into this readme.  
In phase 2, it should have a structure, a good start for everyone (hopefully), but not a complete thing.  
In phase 3, it'll be an ultimate guideline on the topic "How to be a software architect".  

Let's go.

Oh, I almost forget: do contribute, I have a lot of things to learn (eg. proper written english :).

# Phase 1

(don't worry, phase 2 won't look like this)
